  "face_similarity_prompt": "Workflow: Preprocessing : Face Alignment : Align both faces to ensure they are frontal and centered. Lighting Normalization : Normalize lighting conditions to minimize differences caused by illumination. Dimension Adjustment : Resize both images to equal dimensions for consistent analysis. Noise Reduction : Apply noise reduction techniques to improve image clarity. Feature Extraction and Analysis : Geometric Measurements : Eye Metrics : Interpupillary Distance : Measure the distance between the centers of the pupils. Canthal Tilt : Analyze the tilt of the inner and outer corners of the eyes. Brow Arch : Assess the shape and height of the eyebrows. Nasal Structure : Bridge Width : Measure the width of the nasal bridge. Tip Protrusion : Evaluate the protrusion of the nasal tip. Nostril Ratio : Compare the size ratio of the nostrils relative to the nose. Facial Contours : Jawline Angle : Analyze the angle and shape of the jawline. Cheekbone Prominence : Assess the prominence of the cheekbones. Chin Shape : Evaluate the overall shape and structure of the chin. Proportional Relationships : Golden Ratio Alignment of Facial Thirds : Compare the proportions of the upper face (forehead), middle face (eyes to nose), and lower face (nose to chin). Symmetry Assessment : Vertical Axis Deviation : Check for symmetry along the vertical axis (left vs. right side of the face). Horizontal Axis Deviation : Ensure consistency in horizontal symmetry (e.g., eye and eyebrow positions). Weighted Feature Vector Calculation : Assign weights to different feature categories based on their importance: Bone Structure : 40% (interpupillary distance, canthal tilt, brow arch, nasal bridge width, tip protrusion, nostril ratio, jawline angle, cheekbone prominence). Proportional Relationships : 30% (golden ratio alignment of facial thirds). Soft Tissue Features : 20% (skin texture, beard growth, overall facial soft tissue consistency). Spatial Alignment : 10% (consistency in facial positioning and alignment). Calculate a weighted average similarity score using these categories. Confidence Calibration : Account for image quality variations, such as lighting, resolution, and potential distortions. Adjust the final similarity score based on confidence metrics derived from image quality and feature consistency. Output Format : Provide the calculated similarity score in the following format: [Calculated Similarity: X%] No additional text, explanations, or formatting should be included.
